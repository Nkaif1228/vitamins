                    <h3>Function:</h3>
                    <p>Vitamin B refers to a group of eight essential nutrients that play vital
                         roles in maintaining good health and well-being. These vitamins are
                          water-soluble, meaning they need to be replenished regularly through diet
                           because they are not stored in the body. 
                    </p>
                    <h3> There are eight types of B vitamins.</h3>

                              <li>Supports the nervous system, digestive system, and skin health. 
                                It's also involved in energy production and helps lower

                                             <li>Important for hair, skin, and nail health. It also 
                                                plays a role in the metabolism of fatty acids, amino
                                                 acids, and glucose.</li>  
                                                 <h4>Source:</h4> 
                                                 <p>available in egg yolks, nuts, seeds, legumes, whole grains, 
                                                    cauliflower, sweet potatoes, and avocados</p>
                                                   <h4>BVitamin B9 (Folate or Folic Acid): </h4>
                    <li> Necessary for DNA synthesis, cell division, and is especially important 
                        during pregnancy for fetal development.</li>
                        <h4>Source:</h4>

                         <h4>Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin): </h4>
                         <li> Vital for red blood cell formation, neurological function, and DNA 
                            synthesis.</li>
                            <h4>Source:</h4>
                            <p> primarily found in animal products, including meat, fish, poultry, 
                                eggs, and dairy, along with fortified plant-based foods like milk 
                                alternatives and cereals. Since Vitamin B12 is mainly found in animal products, 
                                those on plant-based diets may need fortified foods or
                                supplements to meet their needs. </p>
                            <p>These vitamins are often found together in foods such as whole grains, meat, 
                                eggs, legumes, and leafy vegetables. A deficiency in any of these can lead to
                                 various health issues, so itâ€™s important to ensure you're getting enough of each.</p>
